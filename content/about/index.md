It all started in the 70s. Chuck Peddle and his team at MOS Technology developed
an inexpensive but still powerful microprocessor. The 6502 and its derivates like the
6510 were adopted in many of the early homecomputers: the Apple I and II, the
Commodore PET, VC20 and the famous C64.

My first computer, the Commodore C116 was also powered by this design, more specifically the 7501/8501 flavour.

The 65C02 is still in [production](https://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/w65c02s-chip.php) today. Ben Eater started a
[video series](https://eater.net/6502)
that explained how to build a complete system including RAM, ROM and IOs on
breadboards. I found this fascinating and decided to give it a try myself.
So I ordered the kit from Ben and was instantly hooked.

Here I document my journey and hope to share some insights that may be useful to
others.
