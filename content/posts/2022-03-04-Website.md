The zeromips.org website is made with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
static site generator.

To automate deploying the site to the webserver I have set up a CI/CD workflow
on github.com. This is actually pretty easy. All you need is a .yml-file
that defines the process:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Git checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: "0.64.0"

      - name: Build
        # remove --minify tag if you do not need it
        # docs: https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/minification/
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Deploy
        uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@4.3.0
        with:
          server: ngcobalt387.manitu.net
          protocol: ftps
          username: ftp200017650
          password: ${{ secrets.ftp_password }}
          local-dir: ./public/
```

This workflow gets run whenever some changes are pushed to the master branch.
For hugo and ftp-deploy there are predefined actions that can be used.
The password is stored in the project secrets that can only be accessed by
developers.
